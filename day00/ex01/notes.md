Three I/O memory address locations are allocated for each port, one each for the data register – PORTx, data direction register – DDRx, and the port input pins – PINx. The port input pins I/O location is read only, while the data register and the data direction register are read/write. However, writing a logic one to a bit in the PINx register, will result in a toggle in the corresponding bit in the data register. In addition, the pull-up disable – PUD bit in MCUCR disables the pull-up function for all pins in all ports when set.
